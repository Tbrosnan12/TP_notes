# TP_notes

These are a collection of the notes I made during my undergrad in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin.

Most of them are still currently under construction. I will update them every now and again.
I will also leave a link to view an overleaf document of the template for these notes [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/vhqsjfxnzkcz#f0868a). 
The Tex files for the template are also available in Tex_files/Notes_template

General structure is pdfs of notes are found in the year directories, Third_year ect.. Where as .tex files for the notes can be found in the Tex_files dir.
